Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The dataset includes the following files:
- 'README.txt'
- 'CodeBook.md'
- 'run_analysis.R'

The original base experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

Activities recorded were:
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

Project Summary:
The following is a summary description of the project instructions, which was to be recorded in R script called run_analysis.R 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
